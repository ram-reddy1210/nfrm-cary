ChatUI --> AgentBackend : HTTPS/gRPC

AgentBackend --> VertexEndpoint : API Calls
AgentBackend --> VertexIndex : (via Endpoint or directly for management)

RetrievalService --> VertexEndpoint : API Calls (for search)

' It's implied AgentBackend might use RetrievalService,
' or RetrievalService is part of the overall "backend services"
' For clarity, if AgentBackend directly uses RetrievalService:
AgentBackend --> RetrievalService : Internal API Call

note right of VertexEndpoint
  VertexAI Endpoints serve
  the indexed data from VertexAI Index.
end note
