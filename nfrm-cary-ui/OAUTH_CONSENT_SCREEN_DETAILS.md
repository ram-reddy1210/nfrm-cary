# OAuth Consent Screen Details (Google Cloud Console)

This file contains details that are typically configured in the Google Cloud Console for your Firebase project's OAuth consent screen. This is a crucial step for Google Sign-In to function correctly.

**Project:** (The Google Cloud Project associated with your Firebase app)

**Information to configure in Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services -> OAuth consent screen):**

*   **App name / Public-facing name:** `project-988284952137`
    *   This is the name users will see when asked to grant permissions to your app.

*   **User support email:** `kumar.vinay0210@gmail.com`
    *   This email address is shown to users if they have questions about their consent.

*   **App logo:** (Optional but highly recommended) You should upload your app's logo here.

*   **Application home page link:** (Optional) A link to your application's home page.

*   **Application privacy policy link:** (Often required, especially for published apps) A link to your application's privacy policy.

*   **Application terms of service link:** (Optional) A link to your application's terms of service.

**Developer contact information:**
*   **Email addresses:** `kumar.vinay0210@gmail.com` (and any other relevant contact emails)
    *   Google uses these email addresses to notify you about any changes to your project.

**Important:** Ensure you have configured these details in the Google Cloud Console for the project linked to your Firebase application. The publishing status of the OAuth consent screen (Testing vs. In production) also affects who can use the Google Sign-In feature.
